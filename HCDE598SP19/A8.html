	<h2>TL;DR</h2>
	<p>I built a toy from my infancy using techniques learned and materials used during this quarter... and it works.</p>
	<p><img src="A8-assets/FinalSM.gif"></p>
	<h2>Backstory</h2>
	<p>See the backstory in the previous assignment (<a href="A7.html">A7: Final Project Proposal</a>).</p>
	<p>This was the original concept: <img src="A7-assets/search-results.png"><br></p>
	<h2>SKETCHES</h2>
	<p>Since the design of the box and its mechanism seemed simple enough, I sketched some basic concepts before using more complex CAD software:</p>
	<p><img src="A8-assets/A8-01.jpg"><br />
	  I started with a simple box that had a sliding door, and some sort of rotating internal mechanism connected to the position of sliding door.</p>
	<p><img src="A8-assets/A8-02.jpg"><br />Did a bit of math to calculate the size of the grooves for the sliding door.</p>
	<p><img src="A8-assets/A8-03.jpg"><br>Started ideating how to connect the sliding door to the rotating mechanism... maybe a rack and pinion? Sounds like it could work.</p>
	<p><img src="A8-assets/A8-04.jpg"><br>Another view of the rack and pinion component - from the top overlaying the sliding door and the gear connected to the rotating mecahnism.</p>
	<p><img src="A8-assets/A8-05.jpg"><br>At some point I also started thinking about the 3D printing setup -- I think the most efficient way to print this is vertically, so that the need for supports is minimized.</p>
	<h2>CAD DESIGN</h2>
	<p>After I had the initial sketches done-ish, I started designing the components in onshape</p>
	<p><img src="A8-assets/A8-06OnShapePre.jpg"><br />This was relatively straight forward because of all the dimensions I calculated previously in the sketches.</p>
	<p>With a bunch of parts ready, I put them together in the Assembly section:</p>
	<p><img src="A8-assets/A8-06.jpg"><br />I did a couple of tweaks to adjust for the dimensions I didn't consider -- e.g. the width of the sliding door, which as shown in the image above, did not originally account for the grooves.</p>
	<p><img src="A8-assets/A8-07.jpg"><br>After a couple of tweaks on the components, the box fit together nicely.</p>
	<p>I used an <a href="https://cad.onshape.com/documents/c9a5ab9cc17f4a71b44f9828/w/fe9439076f8347d981a9c624/e/f8117c468d9249649a3ec575">OnShape model to generate gears</a>, and tweaked it to ensure the radius fit the space I had designed in the box:</p>
	<p><img src="A8-assets/A8-07Gear.jpg"></p>
	<p><img>I added the rotating components and played with the shapes to ensure they would properly accomodate the rotation.</p>
	<p><img src="A8-assets/A8-08.jpg"><br>Closed position.</p>
	<p><img src="A8-assets/A8-09.jpg"><br>Open position, with the max rotation allowed. In this position, the surprise would come near the unsuspecting user's fingers.</p>
	<p><img src="A8-assets/A8-10.jpg"><br>Added the first rack and pinion to connect with the rotating mechanism.</p>
	<p><img src="A8-assets/A8-11.jpg"><br>I also added an axis to the gear so that it would rotate in place, fitted inside a pocket in each side inside of the box.</p>
	<p><img src="A8-assets/A8-12.jpg"><br>This is a wireframe view of the rotating gear in place using the rack and pinion mechanism in the sliding door.</p>
	<p><img src="A8-assets/A8-13.jpg"><br>Another view of the internal mechanism, with the rotating arm outside for sizing reference.</p>
	<h2>MANUFACTURING</h2>
	<p>After designing the components, the three main manufacturing processes would be:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>3D Print the gear for the rotating component</li>
		<li>Laser cut the box sides and a component of the rotating mechanism</li>
		<li>Mill the sides of the box for the pocket of the rotating mechanism and the grooves for the sliding cover</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>3D PRINTING</h3>
	<p>Given time constraints, I did most of the work at the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/garage/">Microsoft Garage</a> marker space. It's a sweet space with laser cutters, 3D printers, an Othermill, and a bunch of other tools to build almost anything.</p>
	<p>I started using a Flashforge Pro to print the gear with somewhat unsuccessful results:</p>
	<p><img src="A8-assets/A8-17.jpg"><br />Reminds me of the Ghostbusters' <a href="https://ghostbusters.fandom.com/wiki/Psychomagnotheric_Slime">Psychomagnotheric Slime</a>.</p>
	<p>I turned to the Ultimaker 3, and after starting the print, I noticed some problems with the machine:</p>
	<p><img src="A8-assets/A8-14.jpg"><br />The machine was still operable, but needed careful observation to stop it in case the material leaked or if anything else behaved strange.</p>

	</p>
	<p>The printing completed after ~1h. <br> 
	Settings:
	<ul>
		<li>Layer height: 0.1</li>
		<li>Infill: 60%</li>
		<li>Supports: Yes, please.</li>
	</ul></p>
	<p><img src="A8-assets/A8-20.jpg"></p>
	<p>After the parts were done, the results were noticeably different:</p>
	<p><img src="A8-assets/A8-16.jpg"><br />The quality Instagram content that my friends appreciate.</p>
	<h3>Laser Cutting</h3>
	<p>After the printing was done, I cut the parts </p>
	<p>The settings of the Epilog laser cutter/engraver were:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Power 100%</li>
		<li>Speed 20</li>
	</ul>
	<p>These settings were based on some pre-set recommendations from other Microsoft Garage members.</p>
	<p>

	  </video> 
	</p>
	<p>Since I knew I would have limited access to the laser cutter, I cut a couple of different options for the following parts:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Box sides -- in case I needed to mill extra parts if I did not mill it properly</li>
		<li>Sliding box covers -- from previous experience, the acrylic might melt slightly differently, and there was a possibility that the sliding cover might not fit properly</li>
		<li>Extra parts for the rotating mechanism in case I needed to cut the final version to adapt for any tight tolerances.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><img src="A8-assets/A8-22.jpg"><br />Sliding doors in a variety of widths -- from 3.1 cm to 3.4 cm.</p>
	<p><img src="A8-assets/A8-23.jpg"><br />Parts for the rack and pinion mechanism.</p>
	<h3>MILLING</h3>
	<p>I did a combination of milling in at UW and at the Microsoft Garage.</p>
	<p>I struggled with Fusion 360 for a couple of hours, I had some usable machine paths that would work halfway in the Othermill, then send the milling end rotating endlessly without drilling the pockets.</p>
	<p><img src="A8-assets/A8-BadToolpaths.png"><br />Wtf are these paths? Credit to <a href="https://nraynaud.github.io/webgcode/">@nraynaud</a> for the great toolpath simulator.</p>
	<p>After exporting multiple machine paths, I realized my settings were not right for the Othermill because <strong>there is a specific setting for the Othermill</strong>:</p>
	<p><img src="A8-assets/A8-Fusion360.png" width="400"><br />This dropdown has an option to make the output GCODE for the Othermill, not some random .nc or .cps that the Othermill may or may not understand properly.</p>
	<p>This was me at the Garage after realizing the above minute detail:</p>
	<p><img src="https://i.chzbgr.com/full/9023369472/hD3F036DA/" width="500"></p>
	<p>At some point, the milling happened:</p>
	<p><img src="A8-assets/A8-24.jpg"><br /></p>
	<h2>FINAL ASSEMBLY</h2>
	<p>With a solid assortment of parts, I started to piece things together:</p>
	<p><img src="A8-assets/A8-25.jpg"><br />The box with the gear of the rotating mechanism.</p>
	<p><img src="A8-assets/A8-26.jpg"><br />Carefully (and lovingly) holding things together to ensure the parts fit.</p>
	<p><img src="https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/56117435/superglue-everything.jpg" width="200"></p>
	<p>For the scary surprise, I felt nothing could be more fitting for this project than <strong>the failed print that represents all the unexpected failures encountered in the process of making things</strong> - at least it made sense to me.</p>
	<p><img src="A8-assets/A8-28.jpg"><br />The scary surprise mechanism was glued to the gear so the whole thing would rotate together.</p>
	<p><img src="A8-assets/A8-29.jpg"><br />I really dig the translucent effect of the box - I think it makes it more likely for people to be curious about what's in the box.</p>
	<p><em>Archetypical post-graduate student nearing the end of the quarter:</em><br><img src="https://sparkleheathersparkle.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/whats-in-the-box.jpg" width="300"></p>
	<p>The parts ended up being slightly misaligned due to the Fusion 360 export issues and the milling challenges, but the mechanism worked pretty well nevertheless: </p>
	<p><img src="A8-assets/A8-30.jpg"><br />Rotating mechanism ready to rotate (and scare unsuspecting strangers).</p>

	<p>I added the teeth on the lid, put it on and things worked pretty nicely.</p>

	<h2>LEARNINGS</h2>
	<p>Yes.</p>
	<h2>SOURCES</h2>
	<p>Internets and stuffs.</p>
	<h2>TAKEAWAYS (LEARNINGS)</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Superglue is amazing.</li>
		<li>Laser cutting is fast, and efficient</li>
		<li>Cutting extras in different sizes is helpful if the tolerances are less than perfect at build time. Also... ain't nobody got time to drive to the Mill everyday.</li>
		<li>Fusion 360 is torture - it is far from intuitive, and basic tasks are not easy to repeat (plus what's up with the lack of right-click navigation?).</li>
		<li>Sketching things thoroughly was extremely helpful - made subsequent activites easier... especially designing in CAD.</li>
		<li>Maker spaces need their users to keep things orderly... otherwise tools (e.g. end mills) will be easily misplaced.</li>
		<li>Documentation is boring, but it has helped me remember how to do certain things (e.g. use a mill).</li>
