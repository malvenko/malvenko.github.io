<div id="content">
<p>For this assignment, I dug out an old Ikea &quot;Sekond&quot; light bulb socket:</p>
<p><img src="A3-assets/IkeaSekond.jpg" alt="Ikea Sekond cord and lightbulb socket"></p>
<p>After measuring the socket, and the test lightbulb, I started designing a structure that would be mounted on the socket. and experimented with discs in Rhino to mount the laser-cut pieces on it.</p>
<p><img src="A3-assets/Rhino1.jpg" alt="Shapes in Rhinocerous app"></p>
<p>At some point, I decided to create two discs to place groups of tiles on two levels, and used pillars to connect both discs.</p>
<p><img src="A3-assets/Rhino1_2.jpg" alt="Shapes in Rhinocerous app"></p>
<p>The settings for the 3D printer were: <strong>Base</strong>= 60C, <strong>Extruder Temp</strong>= 230C.</P>
<p>The intial print was sent without supports, so eventually realized that it would fail.</p>
<p><img src="A3-assets/3D-Print_01.jpg" alt="Object being 3d printed - without supports"></p>
<p>The result was quite underwhelming, but at least had some functional parts.</p>
<p><img src="A3-assets/3D-Print_02.jpg" alt="3d printed part with noticeably failures such as melted side"></p>
<p>For the next print iteration, I added supports in the Dremel app so that it would properly print the second level.</p>
<p><img src="A3-assets/3D-Print_03.jpg" alt="Object being 3d printed - with supports"></p>
<p>The final version had good potential.</p>
<p><img src="A3-assets/3D-Print_04.jpg" alt="Finished 3d printed object"></p>
<p>The supports seemed to have done a good job.</p>
<p><img src="A3-assets/3D-Print_05.jpg" alt="Finished 3d printed object"></p>
<p>The inside looked funky, especially because two support pillars were definitely not straight, which would be problematic.</p>
<p><img src="A3-assets/3D-Print_06.jpg" alt="Finished 3d printed object"></p>
<p>As I carefully removed the supports, the actual column for the second cirle snapped off -- it was easier to break the columns themselves than some sections of the supports :(.</p>

	<p><img src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/PassionateTameAsiantrumpetfish-size_restricted.gif" alt="Aggretsuko nervously/surprised"></p>
	<p>Since the initial printing failed halfway through, I used the original disc to test with acrylic cutouts while a second version was being printed.</p>
<p>The power settings for the laser cutter to cut out the acrylic were: <strong>Speed</strong>= 8%, <strong>Power</strong>= 100%, <strong>Phase</strong>= 100%</P>
<p><img src="A3-assets/Lamp_01.jpg" alt="acrylic pieces mounted on the 3D printed mount"></p>
<p>The socket fit perfectly.</p>
<p><img src="A3-assets/Lamp_02.jpg" alt="acrylic pieces mounted on the 3D printed mount"></p>
<p>I felt that the original acrylic pieces were smaller than they should, so I decided to do something simpler that would work better with a single level of acrylic cut-outs:</p>
<p><img src="A3-assets/Rhino2.jpg" alt="Shapes in Rhinocerous app"></p>
<p>Then cut the shapes in translucent acrylic, and a second set in slightly smaller sizes and transparent acrylic.</p>
<p><img src="A3-assets/LaserCutter.gif" alt="Laser cutting acrylic"></p>
<p>The pieces came out quite nicely!</p>
<p><img src="A3-assets/LaserCutPieces.jpg" alt="Laser cut acrylic pieces"></p>
<p>I mounted the acrylic pieces to the 3D printed disc-mount.</p>
<p><img src="A3-assets/LampAssembled_01.jpg" alt="acrylic pieces mounted on the 3D printed mount"></p>
<p>Even if the structure was a bit wobbly, it felt like it added some life to the lamp.</p>
<p><img src="A3-assets/LampAssembled_02.jpg" alt="acrylic pieces mounted on the 3D printed mount"></p>
<p>First test with the first 3D printed disc (note that only 5 out of the 6 notches worked).</p>
<p><img src="A3-assets/LampAssembled_03.jpg" alt="acrylic pieces mounted on the 3D printed mount with a lightbulb inside"></p>
<p>The second version, although a failure in the broader picture, had a very nice base disc.</p>
<p><img src="A3-assets/LampAssembled_04.jpg" alt="acrylic pieces mounted on the 3D printed mount"></p>
<p>I really liked the optical effect of using two acrylic pieces of varying sizes in the final version -- it came out quite nice! </p>
